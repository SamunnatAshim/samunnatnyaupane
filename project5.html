We have to remember one thing that we can make the image small to fit but if we enlarge them the quality goes out. Trying to make an image larger than it is will basically require your image editing software to invent pixels. This will result in fuzzy edges and pixelated images. So resize the image small to maintain its quality Before resizing any picture, first we need to keep a copy of it.
