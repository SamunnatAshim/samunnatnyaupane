    <h1>Effective use of web graphics</h1></font>
    <ol><font size="5">
        <li> Graphics is the first attraction of the webpage. Grapics should be presented with the purpose,organization and style of the page.</li><br>
        <li>Graphics should increase the disgn,structure or inforamtive content of the webpage without confusionor distracting the attention.</li><br>
        <li>Be conform weather the graphic fit on the webpage or not.</li><br>
        <li>Do not use big file size which take a lot time to open the page. </li><br>
        <li>Do not use strong graphic element which can pull attention away from central content or compete with another on the page.<br>
        Because graphic should help to guide the viewer's focus to the important content on the page.</li><br>
        <li>Do not use repetitive,hateful,and horrible images in the webpage.</li><br>
        <li>Do not use graphics to express textual information .Something it may be irriting.</li><br>
        <li>Use textual equivalent alternatives for graphic content.</li><br>
        <li>Be sure there is suficient contrast between the text and the baground color when using text in graphics.</li><br>
        <li>Design graphic elements so that users can easily see the text from it's background.</li><br>
        <li>Be sure to avoid color combinations [RGB] that color blind users will not be to distinguish apart from one another.</li><br>
        <li>Avoid the use of graphics to convey texual content information.</li><br>
        <li>Always remember that using visually strong graphic elements on a page can be useful in directing viewers' attention and providing structure of the page.</li><br>
        <li>Bright and eye catching images may be attractive at first, but after some time you stop feeling interested or excited about the image because it is no longer new, it was funny for a while but the novelty soon wore off. They may cause viewers to lose patience with the site.</li></font>
        <font color="Blue"><h1>Where do you need image?</h1></font>
        <font size="5">
            Visual material is more powerful than textual material. One effective image can replace thousand word. Though , images are over used quite easily,
            we should use them in the correct place where they are really needed.<br> Keep your web graphics relevent to the content beng presented on each
             particular page of your site.<br> 
             Image and its place in the page should be natural. If you have no natural user for any graphics on a particular page , use an image to
             simpaly capture your reader's eye near the top or to break up the text on a place.
